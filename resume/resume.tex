		Worked on a developer tool that validates billions of time-series statistics in the Data Commons knowledge graph.
		% previously: Delivered vital improvements to a business-critical data validation tool responsible for all additions to the Data Commons knowledge graph of over 2 trillion triples.

	\begin{itemize} \itemsep 0pt
		\item Improved data validation and processing speed 30\% by analyzing flame graphs of runtime performance and engineering optimizations in Java
		% previously: Took initiative to analyze runtime performance and fixed bottlenecks, improving data verification speed by 30\%

		\item Eliminated an inefficiency causing delays of 2-3 days for 5\% of all additions to the knowledge graph by implementing an alternative method of data verification that allows engineers to unblock themselves
		% revision 1: \item Streamlined delay for importing a portion datasets from 48-72 hours to <1 hour by coding an alternative to slow cross-project coordination for a subset of the knowledge graph with 150 million time series % 150 million == 5% (prashanth estimate) of 3 billion time series in the KG
		% previously: Implemented a local cache option for validating external references, reducing lead time for new datasets by 2-3 days

		\item Designed and deployed an automated continuous testing process, catching 8 silent bugs within 3 weeks and introducing an additional layer of safety against future regressions
		% revision 1: \item Caught 8 silent bugs within 3 weeks and introduced an additional layer of safety against future regressions by designing and deploying an automated continuous testing process
		% previously: Designed and implemented an automated daily tests of projects, catching 8 issues  across 5 projects within 3 weeks

		\item Brainstormed and implemented an algorithmic improvement from exponential to linear time complexity, reducing computational cost of scaling business logic for ranking data sources 50-75\%
		% revision 1: \item Reduced computational cost of scaling business logic for ranking data sources 50-75\% by brainstorming and implementing an algorithmic improvement from exponential to linear time complexity
		% draft: Resolved issues with scaling business logic of ranking data sources by brainstorming and implementing an algorithmic improvement that drastically reduced cost from exponential $O(n^2)$ to linear $O(n)$
		% previously: Improved the speed of ranking data sources from exponential $O(n^2)$ to linear $O(n)$ time complexity % what did this do? -- have speed already

		\item Kick-started an initiative to support categorical variables in the knowledge graph by redesigning data types and business logic to allow future flexibility
		% previously: Extended existing functionality to support categorical variables and augmented data quality checks % what did that do?
