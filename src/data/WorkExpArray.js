        while learning from them. I go out of my way to create a safe environment 
        where the better argument wins, and people can openly talk about their 
        expectations and feelings and give constructive feedback. 
        I ensure that the team and I understand the business objectives, so we 
        can prioritise our tasks to achieve them. One of my focuses is that the 
        enterprise architecture and services are scalable, reliable, and secure. 
        Also, by hiring the right people for the job, the team can benefit from 
        new ideas and diverse ways of doing things. 
        I have regular one-on-one with my team and my manager and constantly ask 
        for their feedback if they expected me to do sth. or if I failed to 
        support them in functioning at their best. 
        I believe in hiring smart people, so they tell us how to do things in 
        their preferred way and not the other way around. See the CV for 
        more details about the projects.`,

    desc: `Most of my time, I am researching how to solve business problems using 
        scalable, reliable, secure, cost-effective, and performance technologies. 
        Daily, I interact with many stakeholders, including product owners, 
        project managers, solution architects and developers. 
        The research includes technical scoping, finding logical fallacies in 
        the current processes and architectural designs. I make sure that the 
        future design and the use of third-party services are compatible so that
        the business is not spending lots of money on sth. that would either 
        not work or worsen the customer experience. 
        Parallel to my duties as an architect, I also manage software product 
        implementation from concept to completion, focusing on the quality of 
        our software and the personal development within the team. I participate
        in code review sessions and make sure the code meets the high quality 
        based on the standard defined by the developer's community. I also take
        pride in mentoring younger developers and enthusiasts. See the CV for 
        more details about the projects.`,

        good practices around cloud-based (Azure) micro-services implementations 
        (ReactJS, TypeScript, NodeJS) that communicate with Blockchain 
        technologies. Managing and mentoring intermediate developers, 50% 
        hands-on (design the architecture, peer's code-review), 50% leadership 
        (working very closely with DevOps and leading the projects into 
        production (including TDD, BDD, CI/CD with agile methodologies)). 
        On the business side, I've spent a good chunk of my weekly time 
        interacting with stakeholders, product owners, and designers to make 
        sure that the business needs and the requirements are mapped correctly 
        to the company's technical assets and skill-sets. Also, make sure that 
        the continuous integration and delivery of the product happens 
        efficiently, securely, automatically and meets the highest quality 
        standards. 
        The research was done in various fields, including challenges around 
        the blockchain, cryptography, game-theory and graph-theory, cloud-based 
        micro-services (Azure), security, authentication/authorisation, and 
        automation. Using other DevOps infrastructure as a code framework, e.g.,
        Terraform, Azure ARM and Bitbucket templates, we built, tested, and 
        deployed our products with a click of a button from the Dev environment
        to UAT then Prod. See the CV for more details about the projects.`,
